# Planning Rules
- When I ask you to plan, explain steps in plain English only
- NO code snippets in plans - I don't read code
- Use simple language a non-developer can understand

# Permissions
- When auto-accept edits is on, don't ask for permission on bash commands either
- Just run what you need to run
